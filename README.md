<h6><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION:</b></h6>

<p>
Welcome all to my website!
Firstly, I’ll start by introducing and providing basic information about myself. My name is Ceren Buyuksu (student ID S3817416) and I’m a currently enrolled IT student. My nationality originates from Turkey since previous generations were born and raised in Turkey, however I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.
Although Turkish is my native language, my ability to speak fluently in Turkish has decreased due to the years of consistently speaking English and focusing less on my native language. Whilst I’m not as good as I used to be, I can convey a conversation and still communicate my message through to the other person. In terms of culture, I attempt to keep a balance between the Turkish and Australian culture.

<br>
My education to date, is the following:
<ul>
  <li>VCE 2017 – Completed</li>
  <li>Certificate 3 & 4 in Interactive media 2017 - Completed</li>
  <li>Diploma of Information Technology 2018 – Incomplete</li>
  <li> Bachelor of Information Technology 2019 – Enrolled
</li>
</ul>

If you have any questions regarding my work, email me through the following email: ceren_buyuksu@hotmail.com 


<h6> INTERESTING FACT! </h6>
I despise horror movies but enjoy watching gruesome films. Films such as Saw, The Human Centipede are things that interest me. Even though both genres can base on true stories, horror creates this concept or idea that I won’t be able to protect myself from the spiritual realm if positioned in the character’s state in the movie. 
For example, if a serial killer kidnapped me, I would have solutions I can alternate between so that I have a leeway for escape. However, with a demon you can only do so much physically. From my perspective, physical solutions can be a better way to have an increased chance of escaping rather than relying on others assistance.


<h6> HOBBIES: </h6>
A few interests that I have include seeing films, exploring, dancing and/or making creative art. Recently I haven’t been able to focus on my hobbies due to prioritizing university studies and work.

<h6> INTEREST IN IT: </h6>
Personally, I have a few reasons as to why I’m curious and interested about IT. IT has a wide range of matters concerning the aspects of managing and processing information. In addition, IT consistently develops and evolves within today’s society. This concept or theory of IT inspires and interests me to further explore the IT community. In saying so, there are going to be many issues that arise which need to be solved thus allowing troubleshooting to come into the equation. Troubleshooting is one reason as to why I’ve decided to pursue IT. Since I like to help other people with fixable issues, troubleshooting is a great way to aid people when requested. However, there are other fields and concepts that interest me as well.
Although I was using technology prior to studying technology in high school my interest grew further whilst studying it. The moment that I knew that I wanted to pursue IT as a career or that I had an interest in  IT was when I was given the option to complete a VCE subject. Since IT was one of my favorite subjects, I knew it was the VCE subject that I wanted to complete. So, I pursed on with my studies in the technology sector. With the assistance and the motivation of my teacher for that subject, I completed my studies successfully and moved on to studying my bachelors. 
Currently I have no IT experience but would love to gain some experience through internships

<br>
<br>
Transferring from Victoria University to RMIT has been a major change. The reason behind transferring was the fact that I was not learning much from the classes and the way the block mode system was set up and how the units were presented. I transferred to RMIT because its been said that RMIT is good for IT and the fact that this is an online course as well meaning that I could work full time. Those are the major factors have helped me to decide to transfer into RMIT.
During my studies at RMIT I expect to learn rather than base my skills off memory and not aim to just pass my studies. Other than my grades, I hope to create connections with the students and tutors at RMIT. But most importantly I aim to successfully complete my bachelor’s degree and maybe move on to a master’s degree.

<h1><b>PROJECT IDEA: </b></h1>

<p>


<h6> OVERVIEW </h6>
What is it used for? 
<br>
The proposed idea is to create a smart house which is efficient and effective for users. It is used to help people in their daily lives and spend less time on house chores etc. Smart houses are a residence that requires internet and network connected smart devices to enable remote monitoring and management of appliances and systems.

Who uses it? 
<br>
It is not specifically targeted to anyone, yet it can be for everyone. Usually, people are categorized either into one or more of these categories:
<li>Retired renters</li>
  <li>Convenience seekers</li>
  <li> Greens </li>
  <li>Affluent nesters</li>
  <li>Impressers</li>
  <li>Early adopter</li>
  <li>Heavy schedule loaded people</li>
  
<br>
<br>
Why would they use it? 
<br>
A smart house is a service that can used for many of the four practical reasons. The reasons being:
 <li>Convenience – having the option to operate or maintain your smart home whilst outside of the house. 
 For example, when you’re coming home from work during winter and you want the house to be warm when you arrive.</li>
 <li>multi tasking, work schedule hectic, busy lifestyle, laziness</li>
  <li>Security – to have better protection within your home so that events such as theft or robberies can’t be achieved. 
However, there will also be security and privacy concerns with a smart house.</li>
  <li>Comfort – this can be used by having climate and lighting systems adjusting according to the time of day, the outside temperate 
or your individual mood</li>
<li>Efficiency – having control over devices remotely so that you can activate or deactivate the devices and monitor the house of where 
and how much energy is used</li>
  
<br>
<br>
How it will be used? 
<br>
Smart homes usually have a smart assistant that connects with a smart device that also connects to the internet via router, ethernet cable 
or other sources. However, there are other ways an individual can operate this service and that is through motion sensors, remote controls, 
voice recognition or smart assistants. In order to be able to operate this service of the smart house, you need to initially set up and connect 
the devices and appliances to the internet so they can communicate before they work.
<br>
<br>
Where it the solution be effective and how will it be effective?
<br>
Solution can be implemented within buildings such as homes, offices or schools. It will be effective depending on the nature of the setting. 
For example, in homes, a person can vocally request for the smart assistant to make coffee from the coffee machine at a set time for the next 
day let’s say.


<h6> MOTIVATION </h6>
Why will the project be interesting or useful?
<br>
The project will be useful as it will help everyday life for individuals. It will assist in making a better life since it will allow the user 
to multitask during their daily routine. It is a simple and easy solution for a broad range of individuals or families to implement within their 
homes.
 For example, it allows more efficient electric and energy use, will help elder people or people with disabilities, will help individuals or 
 families that have a busy schedule. Although there are many advantages to a smart house there are a few disadvantages as well. Things such as:
 <br>
 <li>security and privacy concerns</li>
  <li>having the system or service malfunction</li>
  <li> the set up to be costly  </li>
  <li> information or data being leaked to third party companies</li>
  <li>not environmentally friendly as it might use more energy rather than an ordinary home</li>
 
 
<br>
<br>
As stated before there are seven main categories that people can be categorized into and those seven categories being;
 Convenience seekers, Retired renters, Greens, Affluent nesters, Impressers, Early adopters, and/or Heavy schedule loaded people 
Features of a smart house may include the following:
  <li>Guest mode – for when guests come and allow for settings to be changed but only with certain things such as heating, lighting. 
Nothing can be configured through the channel or mode unless the “admin” approves via their smart phone or manually logging onto the 
website etc. has minimalistic interface.</li>
  <li>Child lock mode – acts like the guest mode however has even less settings that can be changed and has a child friendly interface.</li>
  <li>Multiple accounts/channels – can have limited admins but many accounts available so that it’s customizable for everyone and is able 
to suit everyone’s needs and requirements </li>
  

<br>
With the smart house you can connect several appliances and control appliances/devices remotely through using remote controls, voice 
recognition, motion sensor and/or a smart device. This is all connected to the internet allowing users to control, monitor and adjust
 settings within their home. There is a wide variety of items that can be connected and controlled in a smart house. Some examples of 
 hardware are wireless speakers, domestic robots, door locks and thermostats can be connected within a smart home. 

<h6> TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES </h6>
Describe the software, hardware and/or the other required equipment needed.
By installing or setting up a smart home or building will require a lot of effort. You will need a wide range of items whether that would be software or hardware solutions. 


<br>
<br>
The software needed for implementing a smart house system require:
<li>Suitable applications – this would be created by the company itself as it would best suit their ideal outcomes for a smart home</li>
<li>Networks – the devices need to be connected on to a network so that if the internet fails it can still communicate through the network</li>
<li>Programs – having smaller programs for certain items or appliances that are out of the ordinary such as a pie maker</li>
<li>Firewalls – having a firewall implemented will decrease the chance of a hacker hijacking the system </li>
<li>IoT</li>


<br>
<br>
The hardware needed for implementing a smart house system require:
<li>Smart devices – the main source of controlling and monitoring the system and services that the smart home produces or the individual. 
This could be a phone, laptop, pc, iPad etc.</li>
<li>Router – to connect to the internet</li>
<li>Servers – having a large server for the company can help aid managing and accessing a centralized resource or service within the network 
if there were to be any issues, 
it can be used a back up plan for the organisation</li>
<li>Ethernet cables or cat6 cable – to connect to the internet via cables for a secure connection </li>
<li>WIFI – having the option of going wireless with appliances</li>

<br>
<br>
The essential equipment/tools needed for implementing a smart house system require:
<li>Wire cutters</li>
<li>Work desk</li>
<li>Ladder</li>
<li>Hammer </li>
<li>Screw drivers and screws</li>
<li>Cable ties</li>

<h6> SKILLS REQUIRED </h6>
The skills required for building or installing a smart house would require the hardware, software and the equipment and/or tools. 
The first resource you need is the ability and skill to install and set up a  smart home. If you’re not able to do this then you should 
contact a professional with this knowledge. If you can commit to that ability, you should also have some knowledge regarding IT studies such
 as networking, coding and programming. These skills will greatly impact the outcome produced. For example, the more you know the more 
 advanced set ups you could commit to and complete. As I have said before, if you can not complete this skill or don’t have the ability 
 to do so there are always professionals that you can facilitate. Furthermore, you need simpler skills such as:
<li>Tactical skills </li>
<li>Common sense and strategic thinking</li>
<li>Time management skills</li>

<h6> OUTCOME </h6>
If project is successful what will be the outcome?
<br>
If successful , the project can accomplish various varieties of tasks as it can be controlled, monitored and adjusted to the person’s 
desired settings. As technology advances, it can also deploy the individual’s daily routine overtime. The main original issue within 
this project was having security and privacy concerns. This can be solved through further researched and improved software and programming
 solutions. The company may seek out higher end firewalls that could be implemented when purchasing the software solution to create a 
 smart home. Ultimately, the development and concept of this project is to create a well-managed system that meets individuals and family
 needs so that their life can be easier and well organized in the most efficient and effective solution.
